=====================
What is Microkernel
=====================

Trying to minimize the size of an operating system which provides the most important services:

- Inter process-Communication
- Memory Management
- CPU-Scheduling

The architecture of this kernel is small and isolated hence it can be modulized or function better in user space, which means easier expansion of the system (simply add applications or services without disturbing the kernel).
